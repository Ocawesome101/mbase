                Start service [91mservice[37m.  Looks for [93m/lib/services/[91mservice[97m.lua[37m.

        [97mlist[37m(): [92mtable[37m
                Returns a table of services, and whether they are running.  Each entry is a sub-table with the fields [97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m and [97mrunning[37m:[95mboolean[37m.
        
        [97mstop[37m([97mservice[37m:[91mstring[37m): [95mboolean[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to stop service [91mservice[37m.  May have compatibility with OpenOS services.

        [97menable[37m([97mscript[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97misService[37m:[95mboolean[37m]): [95mboolean[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to enable service or startup script [91mscript[37m.  If [95misService[37m is true, [97minitsvc[37m will treat [91mscript[37m as the name of a service.  Otherwise, [91mscript[37m is treated as the name of a script.

        [97mdisable[37m([97mscript[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Disable script or service [91mscript[37m.

[97mNOTES[37m
        Due to the manner in which [97minitsvc[37m's configuration is formatted, a script and a service cannot have the same name.  This may change in the future.
