*NAME&
        license - a discussion of Monolith's licensing

*NOTES&
        All instances of "I" refer to the author of both Monolith and this manual page, ~Ocawesome101&.

*DESCRIPTION&
        After some debate, I have made the decision to release Monolith under the GNU General Public License, version 3.

        My initial plan of action was to release Monolith under the rather more permissive MIT license.  For some reason, which I am still not quite sure of, I made the spontaneous decision to switch to the Apache license.  However, not understanding this license -- primarily because I did not take the time to do so -- I made the decision to license under the GPLv3, as I do not want Monolith to be useable in commercial (i.e. closed source) settings, however low the chance may be.
