*NAME&
        initsvc - API for starting and stopping system daemons

*DESCRIPTION
        initsvc& is provided by the *InitMe& init system as a method of controlling system services.  Starting and stopping services require root access.

        Configuration is storeed in #/etc/initsvc.cfg&.

*METHODS
        start&(*service&:~string&[, *handler&:^function&]): ?boolean& or *nil&, ~string&
                Start service ~service&.  Looks for #/lib/services/~service*.lua&.

        *list&(): @table&
                Returns a table of services, and whether they are running.  Each entry is a sub-table with the fields *name&:~string& and *running&:?boolean&.
        
        *stop&(*service&:~string&): ?boolean& or *nil&, ~string&
                Attempts to stop service ~service&.  May have compatibility with OpenOS services.

        *enable&(*script&:~string&[, *isService&:?boolean&]): ?boolean& or *nil&, ~string&
                Attempts to enable service or startup script ~script&.  If ?isService& is true, *initsvc& will treat ~script& as the name of a service.  Otherwise, ~script& is treated as the name of a script.

        *disable&(*script&:~string&)
                Disable script or service ~script&.

*NOTES&
        Due to the manner in which *initsvc&'s configuration is formatted, a script and a service cannot have the same name.  This may change in the future.
