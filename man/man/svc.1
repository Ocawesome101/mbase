*NOTES&
<<<<<<< HEAD
        [Until 2020.7.09]  Due to a limitation with the current InitMe configuration scheme, a script and a service cannot both have the same name and be simultaneously enabled.

        [2020.7.09]  This has been fixed.  Scripts are now run in order from #/lib/scripts&.

        [2020.8.03]  Scripts are now run from #/lib/init/scripts&.
