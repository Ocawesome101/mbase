*NAME&
        vt100 - interface with the terminal through text-based commands

*DESCRIPTION&
        The *VT100& terminal specification is a common method of interfacing with the terminal on UNIX-like systems.  It provides a simple yet powerful textual control scheme through the use of certain commands written to the terminal through, for example, ^io.write&.

*COMMANDS&
        Monolith's *VT100& implementation provides the following escape codes.  Each is documented appropriately.

        *{ESC}& is used to reference the ASCII escape character, 0x1B.

        All numbers, unless otherwise specified, default to 1.  Return values are usually read through ^io.read&.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~A&
                Move the cursor up #nn& rows.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~B&
                Move the cursor down #nn& rows.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~C&
                Move the cursor forward #nn& columns.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~c&
                Get the terminal name. Returns ~{ESC}[%1ocansi0c&.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~D&
                Move the cursor backward #nn& columns.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~E&
                Moves the cursor down #nn& lines and sets the cursor position to column 1.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~F&
                Moves the cursor up #nn& lines and sets the cursor position to column 1.
        
        ~{ESC}[#yy;xx~f&
                Identical to ~{ESC}[xx;yyH&.
        
        ~{ESC}[#yy;xx~H&
                Move the cursor to row #yy&, column #xx&.  Does not scroll or go off-screen.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~J&
                Clears portions of the screen.  #nn& defaults to 0.

                If #nn& is 0, clears the screen from the current cursor position to the bottom.

                If #nn& is 1, clears the screen from the top to the current cursor position.

                If #nn& is 2, clears the entire screen. Resets the cursor position to *1, 1&.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~K&
                Clears portions of the current line.  #nn& defaults to 0.

                If #nn& is 0, clears the current line from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

                If #nn& is 1, clears the current line from the beginning of the line to the current cursor position.

                If #nn& is 2, clears the entire current line.

        ~{ESC}[#aa;bb;cc;...~m&
                Sets and unsets various terminal attributes such as text color.  Accepts multiple arguments per call.

                Each argument is interpreted individually.

                If the argument is in the range 30-37 or 90-97, sets the text foreground color.  See *COLORS& below.

                If the argument is in the range 40-47 or 100-107, sets the text background color.  See *COLORS& below.

                If the argument is 0, resets all attributes - echo, foreground, and background.

                If the argument is 7 or 27, switches the foreground and background colors.

                If the argument is 8, disables text echo.

                If the argument is 28, enables text echo.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~n&
                If #nn& is 6, returns the current cursor position as ~{ESC}[#yy;xx~R&.

                If #nn& is 5, returns ~{ESC}[#0~n& if the terminal's GPU is bound to a screen and ~{ESC}[#3~n& if it is not.

        ~{ESC}[S&
                Scrolls the terminal down one line.  Does not restore previous content.   

        ~{ESC}[#nn~s&
                Saves the current cursor position.

        ~{ESC}[T&
                Scrolls the terminal up one line.  Does not restore previous content.

        ~{ESC}[#nn~u&
                Restores the saved cursor position.

        ~{ESC}D&
                Identical to ~{ESC}[S&.

        ~{ESC}M&
                Identical to ~{ESC}[T&.

        ~{ESC}7&
                Identical to ~{ESC}[s&.

        ~{ESC}8&
                Identical to ~{ESC}[u&.

*COLORS&
        Monolith's VT100 emulator supports both standard and "bright" colors.  Standard colors are accessed in the ranges 30-37 (foreground) and 40-47 (background), and bright colors are accessed by adding 60 to the color value.  Colors can be configured through #/etc/vtcolors.cfg&.

        Color codes, their names, and their default hexvalues follow.
