[97mDESCRIPTION
        cdoc[37m is a tool for viewing nicely formatted documentation on installed components.  It uses an OpenComputers feature wherein component API functions, when [94mtostring[37med, return a documentation string.  As a result, [97mcdoc[37m may not fully work on some emulators.

        When invoked, [97mcdoc[37m will search for a component of type [95mtype[37m.  If the component is installed in the system, [97mcdoc[37m will iterate through all methods, [94mtostring[37m them, and output the result into [93m/tmp/cdoc_[95mtype[37m.  [97mcdoc[37m will then display the file for viewing in the system's manual pager, usually [97mless[37m([97m1[37m).
