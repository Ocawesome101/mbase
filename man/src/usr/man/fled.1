[97mDESCRIPTION
        fled[37m is the default text editor of the Monolith system, superseding [97med[37m([97m1[37m) and superseded by [97mvled[37m([97m1[37m).  [97mfled[37m is a visual text editor inspired by the real-world editor [93mvim[37m while also remaining similar to [97med[37m.  Perhaps the most appealing attribute of [97mfled[37m is its ability to easily switch between multiple loaded buffers in just a few keystrokes.

        Upon launching [97mfled[37m, you will be presented with a black screen, with a red [91m:[37m prompt in the bottom left-hand corner, similar to [97mless[37m([97m1[37m).  This prompt will accept certain commands, listed here.  Note that the short form is usually preferred.

        Options mandatory for long commands are mandatory for short commands too.

        [97mh[37m, [97mhelp[37m
                Print the built-in command list, and brief descriptions.

        [97mo[37m, [97mopen[37m [95mfile[37m
                Open and load file [95mfile[37m from the filesystem into a buffer.  [95mfile[37m must exist in the filesystem.

        [97mn[37m, [97mnew[37m [[95mname[37m]
                Create a new, empty buffer, optionally assigning its name as [95mname[37m.  If [95mname[37m is not specified, the user will be prompted on saving the buffer.

        [97mw[37m, [97msave[37m [[95mfile[37m]
                Save the currently selected buffer to [95mfile[37m or, if [95mfile[37m is not specified, to the buffer's name.  Failing this, the user will be prompted for a filename.
        [97mb[37m [95mbuffer[37m
                Set the current buffer to [95mbuffer[37m.

        [97mbl[37m
                Prints a list of all currently loaded buffers, in the format "[91mid.[37m [93mname".

        [97mdb[37m [95mbuffer[37m
                Delete loaded buffer [95mbuffer[37m.

        [97ml[37m

        [97mdl[37m [[95mline[37m]
                Removes [95mline[37m from the current buffer.  [95mline[37m defaults to 1.

        [97mi[37m [[95mline[37m]
                Enter insert mode at [95mline[37m.  If [95mline[37m is not specified, it will default to 1.

        [97msc[37m [[95mline[37m]
                Scrolls the current buffer so that line [95mline[37m, or line 1, is at the top of the screen.  Scroll is stored at runtime on a per-buffer basis, but is not saved externally.

        [97mq[37m
                Quit [97mFLED[37m without saving.  [91mWARNING: This command will not save ANY buffers, nor does it prompt before exiting![37m

        [97mwq[37m
