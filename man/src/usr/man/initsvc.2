[97mNOTES[37m
        [Until 2020.7.09]  Due to the manner in which [97minitsvc[37m's configuration is formatted, a script and a service cannot have the same name.  This may change in the future.

        [2020.7.09]  This has been fixed.  Startup scripts are now run in order, before services, from [93m/lib/scripts/[37m.

        [2020.8.03]  Scripts are now run from [93m/lib/init/scripts/[37m.
