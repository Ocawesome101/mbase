[97mNAME[37m
        led - line editor

[97mSYNOPSIS
        led

DESCRIPTION[37m
        Before the introduction of the slightly more user-friendly [97mFLED[37m([97m1[37m), the line editor [97mled[37m, or LuaEd, was the default editor for Monolith.  It is less advanced than [97mFLED[37m, but very similar in concept and design.  [97med[37m is inspired by PsychOS 2's [93mced[37m and UNIX's [93med[37m.

        Available commands are listed below.
