        loader - Monolith boot loader

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        The default Monolith loader is found at [93m/boot/kernel/loader[37m.  It exists primarily to keep compatibility with the OpenLoader BIOS - otherwise, its provisions would be placed in [93m/init.lua[37m.

        [97mloader[37m provides the kernel logger and passes the kernel a table of flags.

[97mCONFIGURATION[37m
        The default loader script contains a table of flags starting on line 4.  The following flags are currently supported:

        [97minit[37m[91mstring[37m
                The script to load and run as the init process.  Should only be changed when developing alternate init systems.

        [97mquiet[37m:[95mboolean[37m
                Whether to disable screen logging on boot.  May slightly improve boot times.

        [97mrunlevel[37m:[93mnumber[37m
                The maximum runlevel the system should attempt to reach.  Values larger than 3 will have no effect.
