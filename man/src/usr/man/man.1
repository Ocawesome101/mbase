[97mSYNOPSIS[37m
        [97mman[37m [95mpage
        [97mman[37m [[92msection[37m|--section=[92m<section>[37m] [95mpage

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        [97mman[37m is the system's manual pager.  The [95mpage[37m argument given to [97mman[37m is usually the name of a program, utility, or library.  The [95mmanual page[37m associated with this argument is then found and displayed.  A [92msection[37m, if provided, will direct [97mman[37m to look only in that [92msection[37m of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available [92msections[37m following a pre-defined order (see [97mDEFAULTS[37m), and to show only the first [95mpage[37m found, even if [95mpage[37m exists in several [92msections[37m.

        The table below shows the [92msection[37m numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

        1   Executable programs or shell commands
        2   System APIs (APIs provided by the kernel)
        3   User APIs (APIs provided by userspace)
        4   File formats and conventions, e.g. [93m/etc/passwd[37m
        5   Miscellaneous documentation

        A manual [95mpage[37m consists of several sections.

        Conventional section names include [97mNAME[37m, [97mSYNOPSIS[37m, [97mCONFIGURATION[37m, [97mDESCRIPTION[37m, [97mOPTIONS[37m, [97mRETURN VALUES[37m, [97mERRORS[37m, [97mENVIRONMENT[37m, [97mFILES[37m, [97mVERSIONS[37m, [97mNOTES[37m, [97mBUGS[37m, [97mEXAMPLE[37m, [97mAUTHORS[37m, and [97mSEE ALSO[37m.

        The following conventions apply to the [97mSYNOPSIS[37m section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

        [97mbold text[37m      type exactly as shown.
        [95mmagenta text[37m   replace with appropriate argument.
        [[97m-abc[37m]         any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
        [97m-a[37m|[97m-b[37m          options delimited by | cannot be used together.
        [95margument[37m ...   [95margument[37m is repeatable.

        Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render colored text when running in a monochrome terminal.

        The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.
