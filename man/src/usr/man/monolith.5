[97mNAME[37m
        Monolith - the Monolith Operating System for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod

[97mDESCRIPTION
        Monolith[37m is an operating system, and collection of utilities for that operating system, written in Lua for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.  The name is a reference to both the large black box from [97m2001: A Space Odyssey[37m known as the Monolith and the fact that Monolith is a monolithic kernel.

        [97mMonolith[37m draws heavily from the design of the real-world [93mLinux[37m and [93mUNIX[37m operating systems.  It should be largely compatible with real-world Lua programs.  [97mMonolith[37m includes a selection of other APIs, some of which are defined by the OpenComputers wiki at [94mhttps://ocdoc.cil.li[37m, such as [92mfilesystem[37m, [92mevent[37m, or [92mserializatioon[37m, and others which are defined solely from a utility perspective, such as [92mconfig[37m or [92musers[37m.

        On boot, the user will be presented with a login prompt.  If installing from Git, the default root credentials are [91mroot[37m and [91mroot[37m.

        [97mMonolith[37m features a mostly ANSI/VT100-compatible terminal, supporting many common, and some uncommon, escape codes.  The VT100 emulator supports bright colors through adding 60 to the color;  for example, [91m\27[37m[37m (normal-white) would become [91m\27[97m[37m (bright-white).  For additional information, see [97mvt100[37m([97m4[37m)

[97mNOTES[37m
        When Monolith is installed through the OpenOS installer, a user account will be set up and the root password set.
