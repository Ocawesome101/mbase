[97mSYNOPSIS
        mount

        mount[37m [[97m-rwo[37m] [95mdevice dir

        [97mmount[37m [[97m--rw[37m|[97m--ro[37m] [95mdevice dir

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at [93m/[37m. These files can be spread out over several devices. The [97mmmount[37m command serves to attach the filesystem found at some address to the big file tree. Conversely, the [97mumount[37m command will detach it again. The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device.

        The standard form of the [97mmount[37m command is:

                [97mmount[37m [95mdevice dir[37m

        This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem whose address begins with [97mdevice[37m at the directory [97mdir[37m.
