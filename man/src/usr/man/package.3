        searchpath[37m([97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mpath[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97msep[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mrep[37m:[91mstring[37m]]): [91mstring[37m or nil, [92mtable[37m
                Used internally by [94mrequire[37m.  Searches the provided [91mpath[37m for [91mname[37m.  Replaces all instances of [91m?[37m in the path with [91mname[37m.

                [91mpath[37m is expected to be formatted as a series of entries separated by the [91m;[37m character.
