        package - reimplementation of the Lua standard package library

[97mDESCRIPTION
        package[37m is a partial re-implementation of the Lua-standard [97mpackage[37m library.

[97mMETHODS
        searchpath[37m([97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mpath[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97msep[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mrep[37m:[91mstring[37m]]): [91mstring[37m or nil, [92mtable[37m
                Used internally by [94mrequire[37m.  Searches the provided [91mpath[37m for [91mname[37m.  Replaces all instances of [91m?[37m in the path with [91mname[37m.

                [91mpath[37m is expected to be formatted as a series of entries separated by the [91m;[37m character.

        [97mprotect[37m([97mtbl[37m:[92mtable[37m[, [97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m]): [92mtable[37m
                Returns a protected (i.e. read-only) version of the provided table.  Note that [94mrawset[37m is wrapped specifically to allow this function to work.

        [97mdelay[37m([97mlib[37m:[92mtable[37m, [97mfile[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Set the metatable of library [92mlib[37m such that, when an attempt is made to index a nonexistent field, the provided [91mfile[37m will be loaded.  If the field is found, the metatable returns it.

[97mGLOBALS[37m
        The [97mpackage[37m library defines the following globals.

        [92mpackage.loaded[37m
                A cache of all loaded libraries.

        [91mpackage.path[37m
                The path to search for libraries.

        [94mdofile[37m([97mfile[37m:[91mstring[37m): ... or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempt to execute file [91mfile[37m.

        [94mrequire[37m([97mlib[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mreload[37m:[95mboolean[37m]): ...
                Attempt to load library [91mlib[37m from the package path.  If the library is already loaded [97mand[37m [95mreload[37m is false or not specified, returns the cached library.  Othwewise, reloads the library from disk.

                On failure, [94mrequire[37m raises the error rather than returning it.
