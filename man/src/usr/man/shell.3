[97mNAME[37m
        shell - library doing most processing behind sh

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        The [97mshell[37m library does the bulk of the processing behind the relatively small [93m/bin/sh.lua[37m script.  It provides facilities for argument parsing, executing commands, and features some builtins under [92mshell.builtins[37m.

[97mFIELDS
        [92mshell.builtins[37m
                Table containing all shell builtins.

        [92mshell.errors[37m
                Table mapping common error codes to error messages.  Any attempt to index a nonexistent entry will simply return [91m"failed"[37m.

        [92mshell.codes[37m
                Provides bindings of a fashion for common error codes.  Available are [97mmisc[37m, [97msuccess[37m, [97mfailure[37m, [97margument[37m, and [97mpermission[37m.

[97mMETHODS
        setAlias[37m([97mk[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mv[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Aliases the command [91mk[37m to the string [91mv[37m.

        [97munsetAlias[37m([97mk[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Unsets the alias [91mk[37m if it was previously set.

        [97merror[37m([97mcmd[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97merr[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Writes a message in the format [91mcmd: err[37m to standard error.
        
        [97mexpand[37m([97mstr[37m:[91mstring[37m):[91mstring[37m
                Expands the provided string for variables and basic wildcards.

        [97mparse[37m([97m...[37m:[91mstrings[37m): [92mtable[37m, [92mtable[37m
                Parses the provided varargs [91m...[37m into two tables [92margs[37m and [92mopts[37m.

                If a provided argument is the string [91m--[37m, then the function will insert all remaining varargs into the [92margs[37m table.

                If a provided argument begins with [91m--[37m, it will be interpreted as [97m--[95mk[97m=[95mv[37m.  [92mopts[37m[[91mk[37m] will be set to either [91mv[37m or [95mtrue[37m.

                If a provided argument begins with [91m-[37m, each character will be interpreted as its own option.

                All other arguments will be inserted into the [92margs[37m table.

        [97mgetopt[37m([97margs[37m:[92mtable[37m, [97margdefs[37m:[92mtable[37m): [92mtable[37m, [92mtable[37m
                More flexible version of [94mshell.parse[37m inspired by GNU [97mgetopt()[37m.

                [92margdefs[37m should take the form of [92m{[37m [[91m"option"[37m] = [92m{[37m takesarg = [95mboolean[37m, reqarg = [95mboolean[37m [92m}[37m, [97m...[37m [92m}[37m.

                [95mtakesarg[37m specifies whether the option will accept an argument and [95mreqarg[37m specifies if the argument is required.  If an option is not specified in the table, [94mshell.getopt[37m will parse it in a similar manner to [94mshell.parse[37m.

        [97mresolve[37m([97mpath[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mext[37m:[91mstring[37m]): [91mstring[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to resolve the filename [91mpath[37m to a command.  Checks the absolute path if applicable, all entries in the path, and the current working directory, in order.

        [97msplit[37m([97mstr[37m:[91mstring[37m): [92mtable[37m
                Slower but slightly more advanced text splitting function.  Splits text on spaces, except when the space is between a pair of single quotes.

        [97mexecute[37m([97m...[37m:[91mstrings[37m): [95mboolean[37m
                Interprets [91m...[37m as a shell command as seen in the manual page for [97msh[37m([97m1[37m).
