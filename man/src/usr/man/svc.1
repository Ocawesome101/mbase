[97mDESCRIPTION
        svc[37m is the default service management tool for the [97mInitMe[37m([97m1[37m) init system shipped with Monolith.  It supports enabling and disabling of both scripts and services, as well as starting and stopping.

[97mOPTIONS
        [97menable [95mservice[37m
                Enables service [95mservice[37m to be started on boot.  Services are expected to run in the background and provide functions through IPC or other means, similar to event listeners.

        [97mdisable [95mservice[37m
                Disables service [95mservice[37m.

        [97mstart [95mservice[37m
                Starts the background service [95mservice[37m.

        [97mstop [95mservice[37m
                Stops the background service [95mservice[37m, if it is running.

[97mNOTES[37m
        [Until 2020.7.9]  Due to a limitation with the current InitMe configuration scheme, a script and a service cannot both have the same name and be simultaneously enabled.

        [2020.7.9]  This has been fixed.  Scrips are now run in order from [91m/lib/scripts[37m.
