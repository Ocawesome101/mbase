[97mNAME[37m
        thread - system thread management

[97mDESCRIPTION
        thread[37m provides thread management for the Monolith kernel.  In addition to a few functions, [97mthread[37m also provides a table of predefined [97msignals[37m([97m2[37m), not to be confused with the signals returned from [97mcomputer.pullSignal[37m([97m2[37m).

[97mSIGNALS
        thread_died[37m([97mpid[37m:[93mnumber[37m)
                Queued on the death of a thread.

        [97mthread_errored[37m([97mpid[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97mreason[37m:[91mstring[37m)
                Queued when a thread errors.

        [97mipc[37m([97mfrom[37m:[93mnumber[37m, ...)
                This signal is thread-local, and sent on IPC communication.

        [97msignal[37m([97mfrom[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97msignal[37m:[93mnumber[37m)
                This signal is thread-local. Sent on signal reception.

[97mMETHODS
        spawn[37m([97mfunc[37m:[94mfunction[37m, [97mname[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mhandler[37m:[94mfunction[37m[, [97menv[37m:[92mtable[37m]]): [93mnumber[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Spawns a thread from function [94mfunc[37m named [91mname[37m.  If [94mhandler[37m is specified, it will be called if the thread errors.  [92menv[37m may be used to predefine environment variables.

        [97mthreads[37m(): [92mtable[37m
                Returns a table of running PIDs.

        [97minfo[37m([[97mpid[37m:[93mnumber[37m]): [92mtable[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Returns a table of information about the specified thread (defaults to the current thread), or [97mnil[37m and an error message.

                Information tables are formatted as such:

                    [92m{
                      [97mname[37m = [91mstring[37m,

                      [97mpriority[37m = [93mnumber[37m,
                      [97mparent[37m = [93mnumber[37m,
                      [97muptime[37m = [93mnumber[37m,

                    [92m}[37m

                If the specified thread is the current one, the information table will have an additional field, [92mdata[37m:
                    [97minfo.data[37m = [92m{

                Sends an IPC event to thread [93mpid[37m.
