        unicode - API for working with UTF-8 strings

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        The [97municode[37m library provided by OpenComputers provides all functions of the [97mstring[37m library, except UTF-8 aware.

[97mMETHODS[37m
        The following functions are provided to allow basic UTF-8 handling:

        [97mchar[37m([97mvalue[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97m...[37m): [91mstring[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.char. The [97mvalue[37ms may be in the full UTF-8 range, not just ASCII.
        
        [97mcharWidth[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97m...[37m): [93mnumber[37m
                Returns the width of the first character given. For example, for „Ç∑ it'll return 2, where a would return 1.
        
        [97misWide[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97m...[37m): [95mboolean[37m
                Returns if the width of the first character given is greater than 1. For example, for „Ç∑ it'll return true, where a would return false.
        
        [97mlen[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m): [93mnumber[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.len. For example, for [91m√úml√§√ºt[37m it'll return 6, where string.len would return 9.
        
        [97mlower[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m): [91mstring[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.lower.
        
        [97mreverse[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m): [91mstring[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.reverse. For example, for √úml√§√ºt it'll return t√º√§lm√ú, where string.reverse would return t√§lm.
        
        [97msub[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m, [97mi[37m:[93mnumber[37m[, [97mj[37m:[93mnumber[37m]): [91mstring[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.sub.
        
        [97mupper[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m): [91mstring[37m
                UTF-8 aware version of string.upper.
        
        [97mwlen[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m): [93mnumber[37m
                Returns the width of the entire string.
        
        [97mwtrunc[37m([97mvalue[37m:[91mstring[37m, count: [93mnumber[37m): [91mstring[37m
                Truncates the given [91mstring[37m up to but not including [93mcount[37m width. If there are not enough characters to match the wanted width, the function errors.

[97mNOTES[37m
        In Lua 5.3, some UTF-8 facilities may be used through the global [97mutf8[37m table.
