[97mNAME[37m
        users - kernel-level user management API

[97mDESCRIPTION
        users[37m ([97mkernel.users[37m in the environment provided to [97minit[37m([97m1[37m)) is Monolith's user management API.  The version provided to [97minit[37m is largely a shell, and is later complemented by the userspace API [97musers[37m([97m3[37m).  Note that the kernel-based [97musers[37m API does NOT resolve usernames to UIDs; for that, see [97musers[37m([97m3[37m).

        [97mkernel.users[37m is not directly accessible from user programs.

[97mMETHODS
        authenticate[37m([97muid[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m): [95mboolean[37m[, [91mstring[37m]
                Attempts to authenticate the current process as [93muid[37m.  Returns [95mtrue[37m on success, [95mfalse[37m and an error message on failure.

        [97mlogin[37m([97muid[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m): [95mboolean[37m[, [91mstring[37m]
                Attempts to login the current process as [93muid[37m. Returns [95mtrue[37m on success, [95mfalse[37m and an error message on failure.

        [97muid[37m(): [93mnumber[37m
                Returns the current UID.

        [97madd[37m([97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m[, [97mcansudo[37m:[95mboolean[37m]): [93mnumber[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to add a user, returning the new user's UID.  Only the root user can perform this function.

        [97mdel[37m([97muid[37m:[93mnumber[37m): [95mboolean[37m or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to delete user [93muid[37m.  Only the root user can perform this function.

        [97msudo[37m([97mfunc[37m:[94mfunction[37m, [97muid[37m:[93mnumber[37m, [97mpassword[37m:[91mstring[37m): [95mboolean[37m, [95mboolean[37m, ... or [97mnil[37m, [91mstring[37m
                Attempts to execute function [94mfunc[37m as user [93muid[37m.  [91mpassword[37m should be the current user's password.

                On success, returns [95mtrue[37m and the first two results from [97mpcall[37m([94mfunc[37m).
