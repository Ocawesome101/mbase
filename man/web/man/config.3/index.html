<span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION</span>
        In the beginning <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Sangar</span> wrote <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">OpenOS</span>, and it was stable, and it had 
features, and there was little fun.  And <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">OpenOS</span> was rewritten by <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Payonel</span>, an
d it had more features, and it was more stable, and there was slightly more fun.

        Then there was <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel</span>, and it had no features, and it was stable,
 and there was much rejoicing.

        And behold, then there came a new operating system called <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel 2
</span>, and it had features, and it was stable, and there was more rejoicing.  And <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">O
pen Kernel 2</span> thought to itself, <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">what do the people want?</span>, and the people want
ed <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span>, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel 2</span> added <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span>, and there was still more rejoic
ing.  And <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel 2</span> supported <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span>, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel</span> did not support 
<span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span>, and thus came OS-dependence and to <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel 2</span> the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Developer</span> sen
t features, but to <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel</span> he sent not features.  And there was some confu
sion.

        And the people said, let us make fun of the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Developer</span> and refer to <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Op
en Kernel 2</span> as "an unstable poorly-debugged mess" (which it was), and the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Deve
loper</span> was angry.  And so the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Developer</span> made a new OS, which he called <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Proton
</span>, and Proton was the name of a Steam extension, and there was confusion, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">P
hoton</span> became known as <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Photon</span>. And <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Photon</span> supported <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span>, but did not su
pport anything else, and the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Developer</span> was happy, but the people were confused
.

        And <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Payonel</span> sold <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">OpenOS</span> with OpenComputers, and it was better than P
hoton, and the fiftieth OS war raged upon the land.  And behold, <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Photon</span> was ki
lled, and there was much rejoicing from <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Payonel</span>.  But the <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">Developer</span> wrote a 
new operating system, and he called it <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span>, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> was a new OS, 
and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> was good.

        And <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> was good, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Photon</span> was not, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> was given 
features and support, and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Photon</span> and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel 2</span> and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Open Kernel</span> were no
t.  And the OS world was a complete mess, and everyone wrote code for everyone e
lse, and confusion abounded.
