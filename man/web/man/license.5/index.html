        license - a discussion of Monolith's licensing

<span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION</span>
        After some debate, I have made the decision to release Monolith under th
e GNU General Public License, version 3.

        My initial plan of action was to release Monolith under the rather more 
permissive MIT license.  For some reason, which I am still not quite sure of, I 
made the spontaneous decision to switch to the Apache license.  However, not und
erstanding this license -- primarily because I did not take the time to do so --
 I made the decision to license under the GPLv3, as I do not want Monolith to be
 useable in commercial (i.e. closed source) settings, however low the chance may
 be.
