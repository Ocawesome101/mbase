        Monolith - the Monolith Operating System for the OpenComputers Minecraft
 mod

<span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION
        Monolith</span> is an operating system, and collection of utilities for that o
perating system, written in Lua for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.  The name i
s a reference to both the large black box from <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span> known as 
the Monolith and the fact that Monolith is a monolithic kernel.

        <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> draws heavily from the design of the real-world <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">Linux</span> and <span style="color:DDDD00;font-weight:bold;">
UNIX</span> operating systems.  It should be largely compatible with real-world Lua pr
ograms.  <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> includes a selection of other APIs, some of which are define
d by the OpenComputers wiki at <span style="color:00AAFF;font-weight:bold;">https://ocdoc.cil.li</span>, such as <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">filesystem</span>, <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">ev
ent</span>, or <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">serializatioon</span>, and others which are defined solely from a utility pe
rspective, such as <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">config</span> or <span style="color:00FF00;font-weight:bold;">users</span>.

        On boot, the user will be presented with a login prompt.  If installing 
from Git, the default root credentials are <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">root</span> and <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">root</span>.

        <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">Monolith</span> features a mostly ANSI/VT100-compatible terminal, supporting 
many common, and some uncommon, escape codes.  The VT100 emulator supports brigh
t colors through adding 60 to the color;  for example, <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">\27[37m</span> (normal-white) 
would become <span style="color:FF0000;font-weight:bold;">\27[97m</span> (bright-white).  For additional information, see <span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">vt100</span>(
<span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">4</span>)

<span style="color:000000;font-weight:bold;">NOTES</span>
        When Monolith is installed through the OpenOS installer, a user account 
will be set up and the root password set.
