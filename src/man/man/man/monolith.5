*NAME&
        Monolith - the Monolith Operating System for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod

*DESCRIPTION
        Monolith& is an operating system, and collection of utilities for that operating system, written in Lua for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.  The name is a reference to both the large black box from *2001: A Space Odyssey& known as the Monolith and the fact that Monolith is a monolithic kernel.

        *Monolith& draws heavily from the design of the real-world #Linux& and #UNIX& operating systems.  Except for the omission of ^io.popen&, it should be largely compatible with real-world Lua programs. *Monolith& includes a selection of other APIs, some of which are defined by the OpenComputers wiki at ^https://ocdoc.cil.li&, such as @filesystem& or @serializatioon&, and others which are defined solely from a utility perspective, such as @config& or @users&.

        On boot, the user will be presented with a login prompt.  The default root credentials are ~root& and ~root&.

        *Monolith& features a mostly ANSI/VT100-compatible terminal, supporting most common escape codes.  The VT100 emulator supports bright colors through adding 60 to the color;  for example, ~\27[37m& (normal-white) would become ~\27[97m& (bright-white).
