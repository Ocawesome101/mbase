*NAME&
        svc - manage background services

*SYNOPSIS
        svc ?list
        *svc enable-&<*script&|*service&> ?service
        *svc disable ?service
        *svc start&|*stop ?service

*DESCRIPTION
        svc& is the default service management tool for the *InitMe&(*1&) init system shipped with Monolith. It supports enabling and disabling of both scripts and services, as well as starting and stopping.

*OPTIONS
        enable-script ?script&
                Enables startup script ?script&. Scripts are run once on startup.

        *enable-service ?service&
                Enables service ?service& to be started on boot. Services are expected to run in the background and provide functions through IPC or other means, similar to event listeners.

        *disable ?service&
                Disables script or service ?service&.

        *start ?service&
                Starts the background service ?service&.

        *stop ?service&
                Stops the background service ?service&, if it is running.

*NOTES&
        Due to a limitation with the current InitMe configuration scheme, a script and a service cannot both have the same name and be simultaneously enabled.

*BUGS&
        Stopping services kills the shell, for reasons unknown.
