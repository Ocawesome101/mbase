[97mDESCRIPTION
        svc[37m is the default service management tool for the [97mInitMe[37m([97m1[37m) init system shipped with Monolith. It supports enabling and disabling of both scripts and services, as well as starting and stopping.

                Enables service [95mservice[37m to be started on boot. Services are expected to run in the background and provide functions through IPC or other means, similar to event listeners.

[97mNOTES[37m
        Due to a limitation with the current InitMe configuration scheme, a script and a service cannot both have the same name and be simultaneously enabled.

[97mBUGS[37m
        Stopping services kills the shell, for reasons unknown.
