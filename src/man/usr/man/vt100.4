        vt100 - interface with the terminal through text-based commands

[97mDESCRIPTION[37m
        The [97mVT100[37m terminal specification is a common method of interfacing with the terminal on UNIX-like systems.  It provides a simple yet powerful textual control scheme through the use of certain commands written to the terminal through, for example, [94mio.write[37m.

[97mCOMMANDS[37m
        Monolith's [97mVT100[37m implementation provides the following escape codes.  Each is documented appropriately.

        [97m{ESC}[37m is used to reference the ASCII escape character, 0x1B.

        All numbers, unless otherwise specified, default to 1.  Return values are usually read through [94mio.read[37m.

                Move the cursor to row [93myy[37m, column [93mxx[37m.  Does not scroll or go off-screen.

        [91m{ESC}[[93mnn[91mJ[37m
                Clears portions of the screen.  [93mnn[37m defaults to 0.

                If [93mnn[37m is 0, clears the screen from the current cursor position to the bottom.

                If [93mnn[37m is 1, clears the screen from the top to the current cursor position.

                If [93mnn[37m is 2, clears the entire screen. Resets the cursor position to [97m1, 1[37m.

        [91m{ESC}[[93mnn[91mK[37m
                Clears portions of the current line.  [93mnn[37m defaults to 0.

                If [93mnn[37m is 0, clears the current line from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

                If [93mnn[37m is 1, clears the current line from the beginning of the line to the current cursor position.

                If [93mnn[37m is 2, clears the entire current line.

        [91m{ESC}[[93maa;bb;cc;...[91mm[37m
                Sets and unsets various terminal attributes such as text color.  Accepts multiple arguments per call.

                Each argument is interpreted individually.

                If the argument is in the range 30-37 or 90-97, sets the text foreground color.  See [97mCOLORS[37m below.

                If the argument is in the range 40-47 or 100-107, sets the text background color.  See [97mCOLORS[37m below.

                If the argument is 0, resets all attributes - echo, foreground, and background.

                If the argument is 7 or 27, switches the foreground and background colors.

                If the argument is 8, disables text echo.

                If the argument is 28, enables text echo.

                If [93mnn[37m is 6, returns the current cursor position as [91m{ESC}[[93myy;xx[91mR[37m.

                If [93mnn[37m is 5, returns [91m{ESC}[[93m0[91mn[37m if the terminal's GPU is bound to a screen and [91m{ESC}[[93m3[91mn[37m if it is not.

        Monolith's VT100 emulator supports both standard and "bright" colors.  Standard colors are accessed in the ranges 30-37 (foreground) and 40-47 (background), and bright colors are accessed by adding 60 to the color value.  Colors can be configured through [93m/etc/vtcolors.cfg[37m.

        Color codes, their names, and their default hexvalues follow.
